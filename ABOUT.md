# About JianBrowser

#### Why I will develop it?

In fact, I have a HTC Incredible S with 768MB RAM. You know, that's too small for us at now. And I also have a Amazon Kindle Paperwhite 3, but it runs Android. I let it do that. But you know, its RAM is even  smaller than my HTC(Only 512MB). So I think I will do something for them.

#### Where's the download link?

Emmm...I think you can build one by yourself with the codes, but I also give you the link: https://www.coolapk.com/apk/cn.ltdsa.jianbrowser/ and click the button with the text"下载APK".

#### What devices it can runs with?

It supports Android 5.0 or newer. You can use Tencent Cloud Legu Service to make it supports Android 2.x(Yeah, it's true).

#### How to let it supports Android 2.x?

Sign up Tencent Cloud(DNSPod Account),and also you can sign in with QQ, Wechat or Wechat Public Number, then click this link: https://cloud.tencent.com/login?s_url=http%3A%2F%2Fconsole.cloud.tencent.com%2Flegu%2Fmyapplication%2Fscan . Sign in and upload the app, finally, download the app's new apk file(Maybe you need to use keystore to sign the package).

#### How to make the "Project Files" to a APK?

First, you should download the project files with the button "Clone or Download" and "DOWNLOAD ZIP", and rename the ZIP from "JBOSP-X.X.X-XXX.zip" to "JBOSP-X.X.X-XXX.fas" and then open it in FusionApp. To download FusionApp, click this: https://www.coolapk.com/apk/cn.coldsong.fusionapp , and do the same at download JianBrowser.

So...That's all of ABOUT. If you want to feedback, just create an issue.
