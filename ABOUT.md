# About JianBrowser

#### Why I will develop it?

In fact, I have a HTC Incredible S with 768MB RAM. You know, that's too small for us at now. And I also have a Amazon Kindle Paperwhite 3, but it runs Android. I let it do that. But you know, its RAM is even  smaller than my HTC. So I think I will do something for them.

#### So, who am I?

I'm not a famous person, I just a student in a middle school in CHINA(Yeah, that's true, People's Republic of China, PRC).

#### Where's the download link?

Emmm...I think you can build one by yourself with the codes, but I also give you the link: http://www.coolapk.com/apk/cn.ltdsa.jianbrowser/ and click the button with the text"下载APK".

So...That's all of ABOUT. If you want to feedback, just create an issue.
