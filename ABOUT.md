# About JianBrowser

#### Why I will develop it?

In fact, I have a HTC Incredible S with 768MB RAM. You know, that's too small for us at now. And I also have a Amazon Kindle Paperwhite 3, but it runs Android. I let it do that. But you know, its RAM is even  smaller than my HTC(Only 512MB). So I think I will do something for them.

#### Where's the download link?

Emmm...I think you can build one by yourself with the codes, but I also give you the link: https://www.coolapk.com/apk/cn.ltdsa.jianbrowser/ and click the button with the text"下载APK".

#### What devices it can runs with?

It supports Android 5.0 or newer. You can use Tencent Cloud Legu Service to make it supports Android 2.x(Yeah, it's true).

#### How to let it supports Android 2.x?

Sign up Tencent Cloud(DNSPod Account),and also you can sign in with QQ, Wechat or Wechat Public Number, then click this

So...That's all of ABOUT. If you want to feedback, just create an issue.
